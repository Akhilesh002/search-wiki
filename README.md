# vahak_assesment

A Flutter project for wikipedia search.

## Getting Started

This project is to search any term on Wikipedia. It uses Wikipedia's API to search for term, and then lists all the items returned in the API.

Displayed list items are also clickable. So you can read the Wikipedia's article on this app as well.
